Everyone often assumes that to be a leader you need to be older; you need to be experienced, or you need to be some sort of celebrity or popular figure, however, I am living proof that all you need is a dream, ambition and a support system in order to be a good leader. From my time as the President of the Greiner Hall Council, or the first elected Senator of Student Association, to eventually climbing up the ranks to becoming the President of UB's National Society of Black Engineers, one thing that I have demonstrated in all of these roles, was my willingness to lead and organize not for myself but for the people around me. It is easy to chase a bullet point on a resume or a title at some company but if you do not embrace a broader goal of serving others outside of yourself, you will fail in becoming a great leader. A leader is not always the loudest voice, most experienced, or smartest in the room, it is simply the person that has the courage to bring all of those people together in order to achieve a common goal.          There were times where I wanted to give up, times where the odds were against me and times where I doubted myself and my own ability. I am a Black male in a field where there aren't very much of me, facing a statistic where only 14% of the people who have embarked on their engineering journey's at UB have made it to the end. There were times where I was told that I should give up or switch my major or that ""You go to UB, you don't go to Harvard or MiT or Carnegie Mellon, you have no chance to end up at a company like that."" However, through the long nights and the long days spent working hard and telling myself that I could, I am almost at the end of my journey, interning as a Software Engineer at companies like Major League Baseball and Amazon with return offers from both companies and many more to come along the way. President of one of the largest organizations of color at UB, boasting over 110 active members and averaging 60 members a general body meeting which is a 57% increase from last year.         Will I be a good mentor? Honestly, I am not sure, but I can guarantee that I will put my best foot forward in order to show the next generation of leaders that they can do it too. That you don't have to be the best, or the smartest, or the wealthiest or the most well-connected to be a great leader. All you need is a little ambition, a mission, and a dream, and with those three things combined I have no doubt in my mind that anyone can become a great leader.",,,,,,None,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-burdette/,

Here's a more authentic and heartfelt version of your response:I believe I would be a good mentor for the Next Level Leadership Mentoring Experience because of my personal journey and my passion for helping others navigate their own paths. My time at the University at Buffalo was a transformative experience. I started out as a transfer student, unsure of where my studies would take me. I thought I wanted to pursue a career in journalism, but through my experiences, I realized that my true interests lay in business and economics. I ultimately found my way to marketing, but that journey of exploration taught me something invaluable: it's okay to change direction and that growth often happens when we allow ourselves to adapt and explore.After earning my undergraduate degree, I decided to continue my studies in Higher Education Administration and Student Affairs because I realized that my true passion was in supporting students through their own transitions, helping them develop as leaders, and empowering them to find their own path. Since then, my work has revolved around mentoring students, particularly first-year students and student leaders. It’s been incredibly rewarding to guide them, whether it’s helping them with academic decisions, career planning, or leadership development.In my current role at St. John Fisher University, I have the privilege of teaching a course in Peer Leadership Development and developing the curriculum for our University-wide First-Year Seminar. These experiences have allowed me to share my insights on leadership with students and help them develop the skills they need to succeed in both their personal and professional lives. It’s something I’m truly passionate about—watching students grow, find their voice, and become confident in their ability to lead.What excites me most about mentoring is the opportunity to give back, to help others realize their potential, and to support them as they take the next step in their leadership journey. I understand the importance of having someone who listens, provides guidance, and challenges you to think differently. That’s the kind of mentor I strive to be. My own experiences of growth, change, and self-discovery have shaped who I am today, and I want to share that with others as they navigate their own journeys.",,,,,,None,,None,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjhitchc/,
